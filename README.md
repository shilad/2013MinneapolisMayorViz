# Description

A network diagram of the mayoral race that animates "rounds" of instant runoff voting.
A node is a picture of a candidate and a name.
Their size is proportional to the number of votes they receive in an instant runoff round.
They have an edge with size proportional to the number of votes they might allocate to alternate candidates in future rounds.

The animation basically plays through all 35 rounds, reallocating votes and removing candidates.
There could be a slider to allow people to step back and forth in rounds.

It would be fun to have a leaderboard that shows numeric vote totals in each round.
